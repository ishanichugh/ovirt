# ovirt-log-analyzer

[oVirt](http://www.ovirt.org) together with the underlying software (such as
[libvirt](http://www.libvirt.org) and [QEMU](http://www.qemu-project.org))
produces a lot of different logs.  It's not always easy to find a particular
piece of information or to gather all important events of a virtual machine
life cycle in all the log data.

ovirt-log-analyzer is a tool for sorting, correlating, filtering, marking, and
highlighting the log data and presenting them in a comprehensible form to the
user.  ovirt-log-analyzer consists of two parts:

  * Python library, for programmatic work with the logs and their contents.
  * User interface based on the library, for interactive work with the logs.

The project just starts and waits for your contributions!
